## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL Database
- Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
First, clone the repository. Then, install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following keys:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require"

# JWT Auth Secret
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"

# Gemini AI API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"

# Server Port
PORT=5001
```

#### Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`)
Create an `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5001"
```

### 3. Database Setup & Seeding
From the `backend` directory, run Prisma migrations to build your schema, then seed the database with initial data (activities, communities, and admin user).

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
node seed.js
node seedActivities.js
node seedCommunity.js
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start both the frontend and backend servers.

**Run Backend (API):**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```
*(The backend runs on `http://localhost:5001`)*

**Run Frontend (UI):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
*(The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`)*

## 🔒 Security & Performance
- **Protected Routes:** User routes are guarded on both the frontend (Auth redirect) and backend (JWT verification). Admin routes have additional RBAC validation.
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Gemini AI generation fallbacks prevent total application crashes when the AI model returns invalid structured data.
- **Next.js Proxy:** Cross-origin API calls are seamlessly managed through Next.js rewrite configurations in development.
